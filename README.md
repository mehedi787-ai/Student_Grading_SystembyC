# Student_Grading_SystembyC
# Implementing the student grading system step by step in c programming.
# Project Overview:
This is a simple Grading System implemented in C that allows teachers to input student details, record their attendance, and calculate their grades based on subject-wise marks. The program efficiently manages multiple students and subjects while providing clear output of total marks, average scores, and final grades.

# Features
📋 Student Management: Enter student names and IDs.
🎓 Attendance Tracking: Mark students as present or absent.
📝 Marks Entry: Input marks for multiple subjects.
📊 Grade Calculation: Automatically calculates total marks, average, and assigns a grade.
📢 User-Friendly Output: Displays student details along with their grades in a structured format.

# Grading Policy
Marks (Out of 100)	Grade	Grade Point
80 -       100      	A+	  4.00
75 -       79	        A	    3.75
70 -       74        	A-	  3.50
65 -       69	        B+	  3.25
60 -       64        	B    	3.00
55 -       59	        B-	  2.75
50 -       54	        C+	  2.50
45 -       49	        C	    2.25
40 -       44        	D	    2.00
00 -       39        	F	    0.00


# How It Works
1. Enter the number of students and subjects.
2.Input student details (ID, Name, Attendance).
3.If the student is present, input marks for each subject.
4.The program calculates:
✅ Total Marks
✅ Average Marks
✅ Grade (Based on Grading Policy)
5.Displays the final result for each student.

# Technologies Used
1. C Programming Language
2. Standard I/O functions for input and output handling
